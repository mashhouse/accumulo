This is a thrift proxy server to interact with the Accumulo database.

1. Building

To compile, you must first install Thrift 0.9.0. 

After thrift is installed, compile the project with:
mvn clean install
This will compile the thrift and java files, and will provide C++, python and ruby bindings.

2. Proxy Server Execution

Please note that the proxy can only function correctly when connected to an Accumulo 1.5 instance, or when run standalone in the Mock configuration.
To run the server, edit the configuration file with parameters suited for your Accumulo installation. If you wish to instead use an in-memory Mock instance, set:
 useMockInstance=true
This option will override any "real" Accumulo instance information.

Once the properties file is configured correctly, run this command:
./bin/accumulo proxy -p proxy/proxy.properties

3. Clients

An example java client is incuded with this distribution in the class TestProxyClient. Also the unit tests included show how to use the proxy. Normal Accumulo APIs are emulated whereever possible.

Additional client examples can be found in the examples directory. These clients are tested and function, however, the setup for each language is beyond the scope of this document currently.

In general, to create a client for a new language one must compile the proxy.thrift API (along with the accumulo core data.thrift API) to the language of choice. 
Then one includes the resulting generated code along with the thrift core library for that language to use the proxy.

As a note, many of the clients here assume "secret" is your root password. Protip: to make the examples work, change this code to your password, do not change your root password to "secret".
